            <h3>Our History</h3>
            <p>Inland Marina was established in 1967 shortly after Inland Lake was created as a result of the Southwest dam. From its humble beginnings, it has grown to be the largest marina on Inland Lake. Due to the warm climate that extends year-round, Inland Lake has become a popular tourist destination in the southwest. Boat owners from California, Arizona, Nevada, and Utah are attracted to the area.</p>
